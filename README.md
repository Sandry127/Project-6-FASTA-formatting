# Project-6-FASTA-formatting
Bioinformatics class assignment.
Let's get some more practice with python. Your project this week is to write a program that will take in an input string of nucleotides, and format the string into FASTA format, and then export the string into a FASTA file. 
Use the attached file as the input file. It contains a non-FASTA formatted nucleotide sequence, an accession number, the gene name, and its species.
